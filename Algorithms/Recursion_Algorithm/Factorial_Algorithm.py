'''
The factorial of a positive integer n, detoned by n! is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
Examples: 
1) The factorial of 3 is 6, because: 3*2*1 = 6
2) The factorial of 5 is 120, because: 5*4*3*2 = 120

The value of 0! is 1

The following method shows how recursion can be used to calculate the factorial of any given number
